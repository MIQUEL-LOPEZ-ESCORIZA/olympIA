OlympIA is publicly available software that uses a basketball gameâ€™s digital acta and video file to create an interactive session. This session allows users to search and select specific plays based on a wide range of features, such as the play outcome, three-point attempts, or missed shots.

Each script is thoroughly documented, providing clear instructions on how to use them. Additionally, various files with examples showcase the capabilities of OlympIA.
